# PKMS

"PKMS" stands for Personal Knowledge Management System. The goal of the project is to create a note taking/informational tool with the purpose of keeping my React/Rails skills fresh and fleshing out my Active Record knowledge.

I think it might be stupid to run the entire stack with a single command, but so far it's been handy to manage things from a single terminal window.

To run project:
`foreman start`
