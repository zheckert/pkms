# PKMS

"PKMS" stands for Personal Knowledge Management System. The goal of the project is to create a note taking/informational tool with the purpose of keeping my React/Rails skills fresh and fleshing out my Active Record knowledge. As this is a learning tool, I've been scribbling notes and todo's in the margins- please forgive my mess!

## To-do:

- Re-implement tags and associated functionality
- Style
- Refactor/cleanup
